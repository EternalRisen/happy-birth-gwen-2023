        <p>Happy 24th Birthday, Gwen.<br/>
        you are so incredible amazing and sweet and I'm really glad to be your friend &lt;3<br/><br/>
        May this birthday be a great one for you.  I appreciate you lots.<br/><br/>
        P.S You're super cute and amazing uwu<br/>
        You're very adorable, and super sweet<br/>
        (scroll down uwu)<br/><br/>
        You have some more options as an additional gift too x3 (yes I know I'm a simp uwu)<br/><br/>
        - I can, try to buy you a new keyboard when I can,<br/>
        - I will do whatever u want me to do for a day<br/><br/>
        - Or I can make a custom randomizer of a Pokemon game of your choice uwu (you can play this on your own or we can play it together (we will have a copy each) and play it whenever you feel like it (we don't have to be in a vc for this)<br/>
        You may of course, pick all 3 if you'd like, or none and tell me what else you'd like as well &lt;3<br/><br/>
        Again, Happy birthday Gwen, you are very amazing &lt;333</p>
